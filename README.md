# Calendar task

> FE dev task to build a Calendar widget within Storybook

## Instructions

We would like you to build out a calendar widget within storybook. This is
primarily an HTML/CSS task, but will touch on the lighter side of Vue/Javascript.

The storybook project already has some atomic components and SCSS variables,
which you are welcome to use to assist you. We would expect a mobile-first
approach, using BEM in the SASS, and creating reusable, content-agnostic
components that would be easily adopted across different projects and in
multiple regions.


## Requirements
- Node.js

## Getting set up
1. Clone the repository.
  `git clone git@github.com:boughtbymany/fe-candidate-task-[your_github_username].git`
2. Install dependencies
  `npm install`
3. Run Storybook
  `npm run storybook`
